  Aside from all the fun activites mentioned above, I love to **Dance**. I was a proud owner of my own dance studio where I have trained more than 100 people, got featured in a local movie and performed in more than 50 live events.
  I am a National Player of Handball. I have represented my University in various sports like Basket Ball, Football, Table Tennis and Cricket.
  When I am not dancing, I play a lot of **PC games** (mostly First Person Shooters).
  I love to learn something new. Some random things I have learned include Photoshop, Premier Pro, Sketching, Playing Drums...
